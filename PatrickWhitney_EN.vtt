I’m Patrick Whitney, I'm the Dean of the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.960
'Institute of Design and
Steelcase Robert C Pugh'

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.080
Professor of design at the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.120
'Illinois Institute of Technology'

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.400
and we focus on the teaching
of business design methods

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.840
If you go back in history

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.760
a long, long time people
made things for themselves

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.240
as time progressed

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.600
some people were better
at making things than others

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600
and they called these people 'Craftsmen'

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
and the Industrial Revolution came along

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.920
factories came about

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.000
all of a sudden the markets they got bigger

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160
and people who made stuff lost touch

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.800
with the people who were using the things

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.880
so design methods had to be invented

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.000
to help companies figure out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.480
how to make things that people really want.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.920
A central question for innovation
and innovation teams is:

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.280
What are you going to do?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.560
You're gonna do more of what sells well?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.200
are you gonna do less of
what doesn't sell so well?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.080
That works until the model changes

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.360
and that's what's happening now.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.920
Companies knows that the game has changed

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.920
but they're playing by the old rules.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.200
The old rules were bigger factories

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
bigger distribution channels

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.520
We developed lenses
to understand that world

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.200
those lenses don't make sense
for the world we're working in now

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
we've changed from Henry
Ford's era where he said

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.320
we could have any color
we want as long as it's black

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840
to the anonymous shopper saying

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.560
'Give me what I want, the way I wanted'

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
'I want it cheaper than yesterday'

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.840
There are a number of lenses
that executive needs to use

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.440
to understand the new game
and the new rules, for example:

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.680
The lenses help companies understand

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.200
what people need and respond to that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.040
so many companies are
using the lenses of yesterday

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240
to try to understand the problems of today

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.400
what made companies unique in the past

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.120
is the same thing that's
going to make companies

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.280
sort of common

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.160
and perhaps out-of-date in the near future

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.520
What do you do when
your distinctive feature

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.600
becomes the norm for everyone?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.480
What are you gonna do?
