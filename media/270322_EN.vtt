00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.880
Amen, thank you Lord

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.580
As Pastor Ben said a while ago

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.460
we are in the Active Life Mode

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.380
because God wants to take and encourage you to be who he says you are

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.440
because of that, you be who God says you are

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.620
don't be who the world try to make you believe you are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.960
don't be who maybe you tell to yourself you are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.420
instead be the person God says you are

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.880
because only he who has created us knows our true identity
