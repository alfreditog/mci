00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.880
Amen, thank you Lord

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.580
As Pastor Ben said a while ago

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.460
we are in the Active way of
life

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.380
because today God wants to take you and encourage
you to be who He says you are

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.440
so be who God says
you are

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.620
don't be who the world tries to make
you believe you are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.960
Don't be the one that you
yourself may try to make yourself believe that you are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.420
but be the
person that God says that you are.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.880
because only the one who created us knows our true identity

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 He doesn't say "I think..."

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.040
He doesn't say

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.800
He says: "You are"

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.280
turn to the side and say: "You are..."

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.840
feel the power that is already in the statement: "You are"

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.400
But you are what?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.680
You are the salt of the earth

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.080
Do you see why the atmosphere here is well seasoned?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.000
I emphasize: "You are the salt of the earth"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.160
We are the salt of the earth
